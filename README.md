## 🔍 What is Diagnosys?

Diagnosys has **two core features**:

### 🗣️ Symptom Chat
An AI-powered assistant that:
- Guides users through a friendly question-and-answer symptom check
- Provides a likely **diagnosis** and basic **treatment suggestions**
- Automatically generates a **patient-style chart** you can save or share with a doctor, making future visits smoother

### 📊 Health Trends
A clean dashboard that visualizes:
- Pollen levels (tree, grass, pine)
- COVID-19 case stats
- Flu case trends across weeks
- Local air quality index (AQI)

This helps users know what’s “going around” so they can be more cautious—or at ease—when facing symptoms.
